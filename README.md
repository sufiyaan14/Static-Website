# Nova Creative — Static Website (HTML/CSS/JS)

A clean, responsive static site you can use as a starter for a portfolio, agency, or small business page.

## Files
- `index.html` — markup and sections (Hero, Services, Work, About, Contact, Footer)
- `styles.css` — modern, responsive styles with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- `script.js` — mobile menu, year auto-update, and basic form validation

## How to run
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step, no dependencies.

## Customize
- Change brand name: update the `.logo` text in `index.html`
- Colors: edit CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`
- Sections: add/remove cards, tiles, or form fields as needed

## Notes
- Everything is accessible and keyboard-friendly
- No external images required (gallery uses gradient placeholders)
- You can deploy on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host
